# Incomatic

Incomatic is an industrial-inspired Minecraft mod, designed for seamless compatibility with Create. The focus of Incomatic is to introduce factory blocks that let you pump in resources, processed goods, and more, turning them directly into in-game money. The mod serves as a foundation for advanced automation, economy systems, and expandable gameplay.

## Features

- **Factory Blocks**: These core blocks accept items—raw resources or finished products—through Create's transportation systems (belts, pipes, etc.). Items sent into the block are converted into currency automatically.
- **Automation Ready**: Built from the ground up to work smoothly with Create mod’s automation components, allowing for efficient, hands-off factories.
- **Flexible Economy**: Item values are configurable, so server owners or single players can define how much money each item type earns.
- **Upgradable Foundation**: Incomatic is designed to expand over time, with plans for advanced trade, new economic interactions, and more customizable factory content.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Create and Incomatic**: Add both mods to your mods folder. Make sure the Create mod is installed for full compatibility.
2. **Build Your Factory**: Place Incomatic factory blocks and use the Create mod’s machinery to transport items into them.
3. **Earn Money**: Any item piped or pumped into the blocks will generate in-game money, ready for collection or use.

## Compatibility

- **Create**: Direct and full support for Create’s item handling and automation tools.
- **Other Mods**: Generic item compatibility so any item transported into a factory block can be processed, with more tailored support planned for the future.

## Contribution

Incomatic is open for suggestions and collaborative development. Feature ideas, compatibility requests, and code contributions are all welcome as the mod grows.
